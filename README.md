### Hi there  i'm Salvador BrandolÃ­n ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Chemical engineer doing my PhD in chemical reactions engineering. Specifically, I study the enzymatic epoxidation of essential oils in biphasic media.

I program principally in Python, I defend myself in Julia and modern Fortran.

## My principal projects are:

- [ugropy](https://github.com/ipqa-research/ugropy): A Python library designed to swiftly and effortlessly obtain the UNIFAC-like groups from molecules by their names and subsequently integrate them into inputs for thermodynamic libraries. UNIFAC, PSRK, and Joback models are implemented.

- [ReactorD](https://github.com/SalvadorBrandolin/ReactorD): Python project for designing chemical reactors.

I'm a contributor of

- [yaeos](https://github.com/ipqa-research/yaeos): Thermodynamic Equations of State, Fortran library with both automatic and anallytical derivation capabilities
